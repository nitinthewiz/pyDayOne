pyDayOne
========

A Windows based python app to show your Day One entries and let you make new ones. Tested in Windows 7.


FAQ
===

**Q.** Why?

**Ans.** Because Windows Day One support is sad (read: non-existant).

**Q.** Hasn't this been done before on BitBucket

**Ans.** Yes and No. The bitbucket one is in .NET. Very sucky. Python is cross-platform and has everything you need.

**Q.** Bugs exist

**Ans.** Probably.
